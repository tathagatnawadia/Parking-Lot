#### Multilayered car parking - 
#### Duplicate car parking - 
#### Maybe the guy lost the ticket and just remembers the car number and color - 
#### Lock a vechile and prevent allocation/deallocation - 
#### Deallocating an already deallocated - 
#### Maybe a vechile requires more than 1 parking slot - 
#### Maybe have 2 or more colors to match - 

### Assumptions
#### Colors and command are case sensitive (exactly as per the problem), not plannging to handle right now
